                <h1>Hubble Space Telescope</h1>
                <p>The Hubble Space Telescope (often referred to as HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth 
                    orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most 
                    versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope 
                    is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories. The Space Telescope Science Institute 
                    (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls
                    the spacecraft.

                <h1>Hubble Space Telescope</h1>
                <p>Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired,
                     upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was 
                     initially canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster (2003), but after NASA administrator 
                     Michael D. Griffin approved it, the servicing mission was completed in 2009. Hubble completed 30 years of operation 
                     in April 2020[1] and is predicted to last until 2030–2040.</p>

                            The Hubble Space Telescope has celebrated its 30th birthday by issuing an extraordinary new picture from a distant galaxy.
                            The stunning image is of a vast star-forming region close to the Milky Way, located some 163,000 light-years away from Earth.
