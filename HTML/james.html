                <h1>James Webb Space Telescope</h1>
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy. 
                    Its high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments allow it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for 
                    the Hubble Space Telescope.[9] This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as 
                    observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of 
                    potentially habitable exoplanets. Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging
                    of exoplanets and novas. The JWST's capabilities will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of
                    astronomy and cosmology.[10] One particular goal involves observing some of the most distant objects in the Universe,
                    beyond the reach of current ground and space-based instruments. This includes the very first stars; the epoch of reionization;
                    and the formation of the first galaxies. Another goal is understanding the formation of stars and planets.

                <h1>James Webb Space Telescope</h1>
                <p>Webb's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which together create a
                     6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives Webb a light-collecting area 
                     of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and 
                     visible (0.1 to 0.8 μm), and near infrared (0.8–2.5 μm)[14] spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from 
                     long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.3 μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold,
                      below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), so that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with 
                      the collected light. Its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

                            The newest release from the James Webb Space Telescope team is a pair of highly detailed images of Jupiter 
                            that show its auroras around the poles. Both images are composites, meaning they combine multiple images 
                            taken with the telescope's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) — each using a different filter — into a single, 
                            high-definition image.
